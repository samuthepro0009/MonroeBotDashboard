# My Application - Development Guide

## Overview

This is an early-stage project with minimal setup. The repository currently contains only basic configuration files and a placeholder README. The project appears to be designed for a web application with both frontend and backend components, based on the gitignore patterns that exclude build artifacts and a server public directory.

## System Architecture

### Current State
- **Stage**: Initial project setup
- **Structure**: Minimal configuration with preparation for full-stack development
- **Build System**: Vite-based (indicated by vite.config.ts patterns in gitignore)
- **Deployment**: Not yet configured

### Anticipated Architecture
Based on the gitignore patterns, this project is likely planning:
- Frontend built with Vite bundler
- Backend server with static file serving capability
- Node.js-based development environment
- Distribution build process

## Key Components

### Frontend
- **Status**: Not yet implemented
- **Build Tool**: Vite (anticipated)
- **Static Assets**: Will be served from server/public directory

### Backend
- **Status**: Not yet implemented
- **Server Structure**: Anticipated server directory with public asset serving
- **Runtime**: Node.js environment

### Database
- **Status**: Not configured
- **Potential**: May integrate Drizzle ORM with database backend

## Data Flow

Currently no data flow is established. The architecture suggests:
1. Client requests will be handled by the server
2. Static assets will be served from server/public
3. API endpoints will likely be established for data operations

## External Dependencies

### Current Dependencies
- Node.js ecosystem (implied by node_modules in gitignore)
- Vite build system (implied by gitignore patterns)

### Package Management
- Using npm/yarn (node_modules directory excluded)

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
- Development builds will generate dist directory
- Production assets will be placed in server/public
- Vite will handle bundling and optimization

### Environment
- Development: Local server with hot reloading
- Production: Static file serving from server directory

## Changelog

- June 27, 2025. Initial setup

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Development Notes

This project is in its initial stages. Key next steps will likely include:
1. Setting up package.json with dependencies
2. Configuring Vite for frontend development
3. Establishing server structure and routing
4. Adding database integration if needed
5. Implementing core application features

The current structure provides a clean foundation for a full-stack web application with modern tooling.
