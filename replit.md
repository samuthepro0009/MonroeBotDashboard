# My Application - Replit.md

## Overview

This is a Node.js web application configured for development and deployment on Replit. The project is in its initial setup phase with basic configuration files in place. The application is set up to run on port 5000 and includes PostgreSQL database support.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology**: Web-based frontend (specific framework not yet determined)
- **Build Tool**: Vite (evidenced by vite.config.ts.* in .gitignore)
- **Static Assets**: Served from server/public directory

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20
- **Port Configuration**: Application runs on port 5000 (mapped to external port 80)
- **Structure**: Separate server directory for backend code

### Database Architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16
- **ORM/Query Builder**: Likely Drizzle (based on common patterns, though not explicitly configured yet)

## Key Components

### Configuration Files
- **.replit**: Defines the runtime environment, deployment settings, and workflow configuration
- **package.json**: Not yet present but will contain Node.js dependencies and scripts
- **.gitignore**: Configured to exclude common development artifacts and build outputs

### Directory Structure
- `server/`: Backend application code
- `server/public/`: Static assets served by the application
- `dist/`: Build output directory (ignored in git)
- `node_modules/`: Dependencies (ignored in git)

## Data Flow

The application follows a typical web application pattern:
1. Frontend requests are served from the web interface
2. API requests are handled by the Node.js backend on port 5000
3. Database operations are performed against PostgreSQL
4. Static assets are served from the server/public directory

## External Dependencies

### Runtime Dependencies
- **Node.js 20**: Primary runtime environment
- **PostgreSQL 16**: Database system
- **Vite**: Build tool for frontend assets

### Development Tools
- **Nix**: Package management using stable-24_05 channel
- **Git**: Version control (with configured .gitignore)

## Deployment Strategy

### Replit Configuration
- **Deployment Target**: Autoscale deployment for production
- **Build Process**: `npm run build` command
- **Start Process**: `npm run start` command for production
- **Development**: `npm run dev` for local development

### Port Configuration
- **Internal Port**: 5000
- **External Port**: 80 (for production access)

### Workflow Management
- **Development Workflow**: Parallel execution with automatic port waiting
- **Run Button**: Configured to start the main project workflow

## Development Notes

The project is currently in its initial setup phase. Key next steps likely include:
- Setting up package.json with appropriate dependencies
- Implementing the core application logic
- Configuring the database schema
- Setting up the frontend framework and components
- Implementing API endpoints and data models

The configuration suggests this will be a full-stack web application with modern tooling and deployment capabilities.
